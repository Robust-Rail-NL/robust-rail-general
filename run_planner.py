"""Run the planner docker image on all scenario_*.json files.

An alternative to the HIP solver step, not an addition: it converts each
scenario to PDDL, plans, and converts the result back to TORS JSON at
plans/plan_<suffix>.json — the same output convention run_evaluator.py
consumes, and the same filename run_solver.py writes. Running both against one
location would have them overwrite each other, so run_pipeline.py refuses the
combination.

The image is built and published from ../robust-rail-planner by its
docker-push.sh.

# Named DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSIONS like every other step's, because run_pipeline.py
# reads that attribute by name to report which images a run will use. It was
# PLANNER_DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSIONS, which made `--steps planner` an AttributeError.
#
# The keys mirror the other steps' --version choices so the pipeline can pass
# --version uniformly, but they do not all mean something here:
#
# - "legacy" has no honest value. The planner step did not exist in 1.x, so
#   there is no 1.x planner image to compare against. It maps to the current
#   one rather than to a tag that was never built.
# - "stable-assert" likewise: the assertions builds are the evaluator's and
#   the solver's. This image has no such variant, so the selector resolves to
#   the plain image and the run stays comparable.
# - "edge" likewise: only the solver has an edge channel. This image has no
#   such variant, so the selector resolves to the plain image and the run
#   stays comparable. See run_solver.py.
#
# The version is robust-rail-planner's own (see its VERSION file), deliberately
# not 2.0.0 — that number belongs to the repos sharing an interchange format.
# 0.2.1 is the first image that plans every location. Neither predecessor is
# worth pinning back to for a comparison run:
#
#   0.1.0  matched no pattern for the corridor model's compiled departure, so it
#          dropped every plan's Exit and the moves leading to it, and reported
#          success. Its plans stop at the last service task and are not solutions.
#   0.2.0  emits whole plans but raises UnboundLocalError on any plan whose
#          departing train never moved — fine on SimpleService, dead on
#          KleineBinckhorst.
