"""Run solver and/or planner against one or all scenarios in a location and
record which instances were solved, for local solver-vs-planner comparison.

Drives run_solver.py / run_planner.py / run_evaluator.py as subprocesses via
their --scenario/--output-dir (and --plan/--scenario) flags. Each
(instance, tool) attempt gets its own directory, named after the search
approach rather than the script that drives it:

  <output-dir>/<instance>/local_search/  plan.json, solver.out/.err, result.json,
                                          eval.out/.err, eval_result.json
  <output-dir>/<instance>/planning/      same layout

--num-seeds N runs the solver N times per instance instead of once, each
seed getting its own local_search/seed<i>/ subdirectory with that same
layout (planning is unaffected -- run_planner.py has no seed concept).
report_results.py/coverage_analysis.py detect and handle both layouts.

result.json (written by run_solver.py/run_planner.py) records whether the
tool produced a plan; eval_result.json (written by run_evaluator.py, only
when a plan was produced) carries the "solved" verdict — solved is decided
by the evaluator alone, never by the solver/planner's own exit code.

Runs run_generator.py over the location first (cheap relative to solving/
planning) so every configurations/scenario_config_*.json has a matching
scenarios/scenario_*.json before instances are resolved. --config-dir
restricts both generation and the instances that follow it to one external
directory of configs, instead of the location's own configurations/.

Finishes by running report_results.py over --output-dir, writing runs.csv and
feasibility.csv there, then coverage_analysis.py, writing
coverage_analysis.txt (RQ1 coverage + Wilson intervals + exact McNemar test,
per the experimental-setup doc) -- both skipped on --dry-run, since a dry
run's results are never fresh.

progress.csv (instance, local_search, planning -- "done"/blank) is rewritten
in --output-dir after every (instance, tool) attempt finishes, whether that
finish came from a real evaluator call or from the tool failing/timing out
before ever reaching one -- a live view of how far a long run has gotten.
